#Heading

```Headings are subtitles or titles that you want on your display

HTML headings are ranged from <h1> to <h6>

<h1> is the biggest header, used for the title, the most important thing

<h6> is the smallest header, used for a small subtitle and the least important thing 

It goes from biggest to smallest text size:

<h1>Biggest</h1>

<h2>Second Biggest</h2>

<h3>Third Biggest</h3>

<h4>Third Smallest</h4>

<h5>Second Smallest</h5>

<h6>Smallest<h6>

Headings are important because users navigate through a web page using the headers to get more 
information about what the paragraph under it is about, therefore it is important to know which header type to use based on importance of the text udner it

You can change the default header size of any header using the style attribute, using: <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>```
