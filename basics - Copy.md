#HTML BASICS 
```HTML - hypertext markup language is a markup language which is used for creating Web pages, it describes the structure of the Web page```

#Basic structure
```In HTML, a basic structure is required so the program knows where each piece of code goes. This is split into two main parts, the HEAD and the BODY. It looks like this: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

The title is what appears in the pages tab, this is always put under the HEAD

The actual HTML code is always put under the BODY

<!DOCTYPE html> is required at the top as it tells your editor that you are going to be using HTML```
